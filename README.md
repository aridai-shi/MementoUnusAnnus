# Memento Unus Annus

A tiny image generator tool to create little memoirs of what we've done during the livespan of Unus Annus. 
The tool is availible for download in [Releases](https://github.com/aridai-shi/MementoUnusAnnus/releases).
## Before you begin - Unus Annus Video List
This tool comes with a list of all of the Unus Annus videos, so you may pick your favourite. However, because of the nature of UA, it is extremely difficult to keep the built-in video list up to date. If you wish to update it, you can supplement your own list, by putting a ``ShorterUA.txt`` file next to the tool's file. To get the latest one, [right click this link > 'Save As'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aridai-shi/MementoUnusAnnus/main/project/ShorterUA.txt). If the latest file still doesn't have your favourite episode, you can edit it manually.
Each episode only has it's first 30 letters, followed by "..." if it's too long.
## How to use it?
There are four things you must input to create a Memoir.

 1. **Your name/username** - We want to know whose Memoir this is.
 2. **Your favourite Unus Annus video** - This is what the video list is for - you can select any UA video made at the time of download (or even beyond with the custom ``ShorterUA.txt``). If the list is too long to display (and it almost certainly is) you can scroll through it with the scroll wheel on your mouse.
 3. **Your memory** - This is the beating heart of the Memoir. You have to answer a simple question: "What did you do during the livespan of Unus Annus". It can be anything you want, but it should be truthful. It can be as impressive as "I scaled Mount Fuji" or as mundane as "I stayed home because of COVID" - we won't judge!
 4. **The theme** - A purely cosmetic change, but it can serve as an effective way to immortalize your alignment, either as an Unus or an Annus. Unus is simply white text on a black background and Annus is black text on a white background.

After inputing these four pieces of information, press 'Confirm' and your card shall appear before you. The file is located in the Memoirs folder, which should be in the same directory as the tool itself.
If you want to help out, please share the Memoirs with the #MementoUnusAnnus and a link to the tool. This might help Mark and Ethan see this during the final livestream!
## Issues and help
I am aware of how wonky this tool can be, considering I could only test it on Windows 10. If there are any issues in the Mac and Linux builds (or if I screwed something up in Windows, too) feel free to open an Issue in the Github repo or message me directly on Discord (@aridai#3842). The only issue that is exempt from this is "The list isn't updated!", because it's usually a matter of "This episode was released minutes ago, and as such I didn't have the time to update it.". Besides, you can update it yourself [as discussed at the start](#Before-you-begin---Unus-Annus-Video-List).
## Final words
Unus Annus came into being at the perfect time. Sure, 2020 was one of the most chaotic and awful years in recent memory, what with all of the crises, pandemic and social alike. But there was also a lot of good happening in that chaos. There was no better time for a piece of media with a message of "Life moves on and leaves, whenther we like it or not, so we should make each second count.". That message stuck in my head throughout the year, and as such, this year I managed to work through some of my personal issues, make some new friends and better my programming skills. As such, I saw it fitting to give a bit of my time and experience to make something, in order immortalize a wonderful channel that was doomed to die at the outset. I wanted for something to stay with me out of Unus Annus, because

So, as an example of what this thing can do, and my personal send-off to Unus Annus, here's my Memoir:

Memento Mori. It's been fun, Mark and Ethan. Thanks for the memories!
